# Argo community contributed documentation

**Work-In-Progress**: This repository is in setup stage currently.

## Purpose

This repository is a collection of community contributed documentation for
the [Argo project](https://argoproj.github.io) and its sub-projects, currently
focused on development & contributing documentation.

## Contributing to this repository

We want to make contributing to this repository to be as easy as possible
and everyone is invited to contribute in alignment to the Argo project's
[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

We don't implement rigid review processes on your submissions to this repo,
and neither do we run a huge chunk of CI jobs to validate the submissions.

We do run two actions:

* spell-checker action, however. **TODO**: Provide info on spell checker and its configuration
* validation of mkdocs requirements

## License

The community contributed documentation is licensed under the
[Apache License v2.0](LICENSE).

## Language

Please use English as the only language for the time being. If there is demand
for having documentation contributions for certain languages, let us know
and we'll see how this could possibly implemented.

## Repository structure

The top-level structure is reserved for the Argo sub-projects and general
repository configuration and documentation, such as this README.

Below each sub-project, the next level directories represent the target
audience, for example `user`, `developer`, etc.
